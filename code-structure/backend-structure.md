# Laravel Backend Folder Structure

> **This is the target, not a description of the repo.** Where it differs today:
> `app/Helpers` holds a single `helpers.php`, not the three helper classes below; API
> controllers live at `app/Http/Controllers/V1/{Admin,Client}/{Feature}/`, with the
> web-side controllers — Inertia page renders plus the login and password form
> handlers — under `app/Http/Controllers/{Admin,Client,Auth}/`. Follow
> this for **new** feature folders; follow the surrounding code when editing an
> existing one. `CLAUDE.md` holds the target-vs-current table.

# Auth Guards

Two audiences (staff in `users`, clients in `clients`), each with a session
guard for browser pages and a token guard for the API. Defined in
`config/auth.php`.

| Audience | Provider | Browser pages (session cookie) | API (Bearer token) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Staff | `users` | `web` | `sanctum` |
| Clients | `clients` | `client-web` | `client` |

Pick by **how the request authenticates**, not by who is calling:

* `routes/web.php` and `routes/web-admin.php` render Inertia pages, so they use
  the session guards — `auth:client-web` and `auth:sanctum` respectively.
  A page navigation sends a cookie, never an `Authorization` header, so a token
  guard rejects every one of those requests.
* `routes/api.php` lists both, e.g. `auth:sanctum,client,client-web`, so one
  endpoint serves the mobile app's token and the browser's cookie.

The URL split follows the same line: staff live under `/admin` (mounted in
`bootstrap/app.php`), the client portal on the base URL.

# Rules

* Feature-wise folder structure
* Controllers handle request and response only
* Validation stays inside Requests
* Business logic stays inside Services
* Response formatting stays inside Resources
* Reusable utilities stay inside Helpers
* Use Eloquent ORM only, But For Performance & Simplicity Can Use Query Builder
* No Query Builder or Raw SQL
* Keep code clean, minimal, and scalable
* Avoid unnecessary methods and files
* No comments inside code

# Transactions

A Service method wraps in `DB::transaction()` when it performs **more than one
write**. Count writes per method, not per file: a service whose `create`,
`update` and `delete` each issue a single statement needs no transaction, because
one statement is already atomic.

Count the writes you cannot see. A single `Model::create()` is a multi-write when
an observer hangs off it — `Project::create()` fires `ProjectObserver::created`,
which generates milestones and opens a `ProjectAssignment`. Without a
transaction a failure in either leaves the parent row committed on its own.

Nested `DB::transaction()` is fine. The `Actions/Project/*` classes open their
own, and Laravel turns the inner one into a savepoint, so an action stays correct
whether it is called on its own or from inside a wrapped service method.

Side effects that a rollback cannot undo stay out of the transaction body:

* Events and notifications go through `DB::afterCommit()`, so nothing fires for
  work that never landed.
* Queued jobs are covered globally by `'after_commit' => true` in
  `config/queue.php` — a worker can otherwise pick up a job before its rows commit.
* Filesystem writes happen outside the transaction and are compensated on failure
  (see the orphan-file cleanup in `ClientService` / `UserService`), because a
  rollback will not delete an uploaded file.
